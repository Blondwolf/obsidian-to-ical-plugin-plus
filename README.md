# Obsidian to iCal

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that searches your Obsidian vault for tasks that contain dates, and generates a calendar in iCal format that can be imported into your preferred calendar application.

## How it works

Periodically, the plugin will:

1. Find all tasks in your vault (A valid task is a Markdown checkbox (either checked or not) that contains a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Generate an iCal calendar file that contains all of these tasks
3. Upload the iCal calendar to GitHub Gist

You can then use the URL to your Gist in your preferred calendar application.

Your vault will be scanned every now and then for changes to tasks to keep your calendar up-to-date. Your calendar application will periodically query your iCal calendar stored on GitHub. So there can be a short lag between when a task is added to when you will see it in your calendar.
